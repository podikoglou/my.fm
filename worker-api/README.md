# my.fm Worker API

The API and Spotify ingestion Worker for my.fm. It runs on Cloudflare Workers
with D1, Better Auth, and a Cron Trigger. The resources are declared in
`src/alchemy.ts`. The root Alchemy stack deploys this Worker with the web
application.

## Stack

- Cloudflare Worker with Hono and Better Auth
- D1 database with Drizzle
- Cron Trigger for Spotify ingestion
- Alchemy stack in the repository root

## Run

From the repository root:

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

`bun run dev` starts the app, the API, and a local D1 database. Alchemy prints
the app and API URLs.

Deploy or remove this stage:

```sh
bun run deploy
bun run destroy
```

In this package:

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run fmt
bun run test
bun run db:generate
```

## Configuration

The root `.env` holds `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Alchemy generates `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` on the first deploy and keeps it in
stack state. Do not set it by hand.

Register the app's Spotify callback URL in the Spotify application. The root
README shows the local callback URL.
